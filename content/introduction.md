Samurai Majika is a popular anime series based on an underground light novel that first surfaced in 2005 but experienced a resurgence in 2019 when Studio Trigger took on the animation. While it has experienced numerous copyrighting issues over its distribution and merchandise rights, the series has become a hit with international audiences and has consistently topped SoftSquareâ€™s anime chart for downloads and views.

Samurai Majika, (trans. Magical Samurai) takes place in the fictional land of Rokugani, loosely based off of feudal Japan with fantasy elements such as magic, oni, and kami. The story follows three initiates, Natsuki, Jotaro, and Hideaki as they travel across the land, upholding the samurai code, stopping the Spider Clan, and unraveling a conspiracy that threatens to uproot the existing order of the Empire.

Initially, Studio Trigger released a pilot episode revolving around ______, with the intention of using it as a TV filler for late night runs and a bot-generated episodic storyline with a monster-of-the-week structure if the it did not perform well in ratings. The series has since gone on to become a popular anime with four seasons so far, with a movie finale and unconfirmed sequel. As of February 2020, the manga has over 26 million copies in print, with a fighting and mobile game as well as some unlicensed cameos in dating sims.
